# SHO Boost PCB

This is my first go at doing any sort of PCB work, so I picked a simple boost circuit: the Zvex SHO.  To make it more usable for my use-case, I included the master volume control mod you've probably seen elsewhere.

## Getting it made

For Oshpark you can upload the KiCad PCB file directly and it should Just Work. For other fabs grab the files in the `gerber` folder.
